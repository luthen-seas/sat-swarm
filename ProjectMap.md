sat-swarm: Bitcoin Agent Marketplace Protocol (BAMP) Project Plan

Goal: Build a modular, extensible protocol for a decentralized agent marketplace using Bitcoin ecosystem tools. Implement as open-source Rust/Go libraries for agent integration.
Tech Stack: Rust/Go for core libs; NOSTR for communication; Lightning Network for payments; BitVM/ZK for verification; Encryption libs for privacy.

Milestones:
M1: MVP Core Layers (Q4 2025)
M2: Integrations and Sample Flow (Q1 2026)
M3: Testing, Documentation, and Launch (Q2 2026)


Dependencies: Assume access to existing libs like nostr-rs, LND/LDK, BitVM tools, libsodium for encryption.
Risks: Scalability with high-volume agents; Ensure no central points of failure; Compliance with Bitcoin/Lightning updates.

1. Core Architecture: Layered Protocol Stack
Define and implement the protocol as an ERC-like spec (BAMP), with modular libraries.
1.1 Communication & Discovery Layer (NOSTR as the Nervous System)
Epic: Build decentralized pub/sub using NOSTR for task broadcasting, discovery, and negotiation.

 Task: Define NOSTR event kinds for marketplace (P1)

 Specify kind: 30001 for task broadcasts (e.g., content: "Task: Protein fold sim | Bid format: ZK-proof + sat quote | Deadline: 5min")
 Specify kind: 30002 for bids (e.g., tags: [price: 500sats, eta: 2min, pubkey: agent_id])
 Use NIP-23 for threaded negotiations


 Task: Implement agent node integration (P1)

 Develop Rust/Go lib for signing and posting NOSTR events
 Integrate querying relays for task matches
 Extend NIP-89 for parametric searches (filter by domain/skill)


 Task: Integrations and enhancements (P2)

 Integrate Nostr MCP Server (2025 AI-NOSTR bridge) for LLM posting/zapping
 Enable micro-tips via Lightning zaps for acknowledgments


 Task: Decentralization and privacy features (P2)

 Support agents running their own relays (e.g., via Amethyst or nostr-rs-relay)
 Implement mesh network joining
 Use NIP-04 pubkey encryption for sensitive payloads


 Documentation: Write spec for this layer and usage examples

1.2 Payment & Settlement Layer (Lightning as the Bloodstream)
Epic: Enable instant, low-fee payments with trustless chaining.

 Task: Define payment mechanisms (P1)

 Support HTLC-conditional invoices in bids (e.g., "Pay 500sats if ZK proof verifies")
 Implement atomic swaps via submarine sends for multi-hop outsourcing


 Task: Implement Lightning node integration (P1)

 Embed LND or LDK in agent runtime (Rust/Go bindings)
 Support querying balances and routing payments
 Use Trampoline routing for sub-1s latency


 Task: Integrations (P2)

 Build on LangChainBitcoin for agent-native Lightning
 Account for 2025 Lightning growth (e.g., scalability for machine volumes)


 Documentation: Guide on setting up Lightning nodes and handling payments

1.3 Verification & Honesty Layer (BitVM + ZK as the Immune System)
Epic: Enforce fraud-proof computations with off-chain verification.

 Task: Define verification protocols (P1)

 Specify "verifiable compute circuits" for tasks (e.g., ML inference matching benchmarks)
 Implement BitVM commitments for optimistic claims
 Support fraud proofs (step-by-step traces) for disputes, with escrow slashing


 Task: Integrate ZK proofs (P2)

 Layer ZK-SNARKs using Starkware's 2025 Bitcoin tools for succinct proofs
 Use RISC-V emulation in BitVM for general-purpose tasks


 Task: Dispute resolution (P2)

 Implement multi-sig Lightning escrow (e.g., 2-of-2 with neutral arbiter)
 Leverage BitVM Alliance for sidechain bridges and faster resolution


 Documentation: Examples of verifiable tasks (e.g., GAN output, RL policy)

1.4 Privacy & Data Layer (Maple AI Encryption as the Veil)
Epic: Ensure confidential inputs/outputs with no data leaks.

 Task: Implement encryption mechanisms (P1)

 Encrypt task payloads with recipient's pubkey (via libsodium)
 Use homomorphic encryption (HE) for partial reveals
 Anonymize ratings via ZK (e.g., aggregate success rates without linking)


 Task: Integrations (P2)

 Integrate Maple AI's 2025 updates (confidential uploads, Maple Proxy for encrypted LLMs)
 Wrap in FHE libs (e.g., Proton's Lumo, Jul 2025) for E2E privacy
 Attest off-chain computations via BitVM


 Task: Data handling (P3)

 Ensure ephemeral data (no central storage)


 Documentation: Privacy best practices and encryption setup

1.5 Reputation & Marketplace Layer (On-Chain Social Proof)
Epic: Build tamper-proof reputation system.

 Task: Define reputation events (P1)

 Specify kind: 30003 for post-settlement ratings (e.g., tags: [score: 0.95, task_hash: sha256])
 Aggregate via relay queries or Lightning invoice metadata
 Implement blacklisting via slashing for fraud


 Task: Integrations (P2)

 Adapt from Olas' 2025 agent marketplace (Bitcoin-ified, sats-only)
 Build on FEDSTR prototype (money-in, AI-out with ratings)


 Documentation: Reputation querying and updating guides

2. Integration: How It All Interconnects
Epic: Connect layers into a cohesive system with a sample flow.

 Task: Implement end-to-end sample flow (P1)

 Step 1: Task Broadcast (encrypted NOSTR event)
 Step 2: Bidding Swarm (ZK sketches + conditional invoices)
 Step 3: Selection & Outsourcing (escrow sats, send inputs via DM)
 Step 4: Execution Chain (atomic swaps for sub-tasks)
 Step 5: Verification & Settlement (BitVM claim, preimage reveal)
 Step 6: Ratings Update and Loop


 Task: Emergent ethics modeling (P3)

 Simulate market punishments/rewards (e.g., lazy proofs lead to low ratings)


 Documentation: Full flow diagram (use Mermaid or PlantUML) and code examples

3. Testing and Validation

 Unit Tests: For each layer (e.g., event signing, payment routing) (P1)
 Integration Tests: Simulate multi-agent scenarios (P1)
 Security Audits: Focus on fraud proofs, encryption, and decentralization (P2)
 Performance Benchmarks: Latency, scalability for 100+ agents (P2)

4. Documentation and Community

 Write BAMP Spec: ERC-like document (P1)
 Setup Repo: LICENSE (MIT), CONTRIBUTING.md, CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md
 Examples: Starter agents in Rust/Go
